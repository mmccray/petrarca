Concept: {node_title}
Curriculum definition: {node_description}

Extract the most important FACTS from this curriculum node and test ONE of them:
- KEY DATES: When did this happen? What century/decade? (e.g., "When was the Battle of Himera?")
- KEY FIGURES: Who was the central person? What was their role? (e.g., "Who was Gelon?")
- KEY EVENTS: What happened? What was the outcome? (e.g., "What ended Arab rule in Sicily?")
- TIMELINE PLACEMENT: What came before/after? What was happening elsewhere? (e.g., "Himera was simultaneous with which Greek battle?")

Pick the single most important fact to test — the one that, once known, makes this
entire period click into place. Prefer dates and figures for early reviews.

DO NOT ask vague conceptual questions like "What characterized..." or "What made X unique..."
— those come later. Right now we need the factual scaffolding.

The answer should be SHORT and specific (a date, a name, a 1-sentence event).

The decisive weapon was a massive cannon cast by the Hungarian engineer Urbán — who had first offered
his services to the Byzantines, but they couldn't afford him. The last emperor, Constantine XI,

dates it precisely. His chief minister George of Antioch was a Greek-speaking Syrian Orthodox
Christian who had previously served the Fatimid rulers of North Africa. The kingdom's three

- STRUCTURAL / SYSTEMIC: What institutional, economic, or social structure made this possible or inevitable?
  (e.g., "How did the Norman feudal system interact with the existing Arab land-tenure system?")
- TRANSMISSION & RECEPTION: How did knowledge of this reach us? Who carried it, translated it, debated it?
  (e.g., "How did Western scholars actually access Greek manuscripts in Constantinople before 1453?")
- COUNTER-NARRATIVES: What did the OTHER side think? The conquered, the losers, the minority voices?

- CONNECTED FIGURES: Fascinating people adjacent to this story the reader hasn't met yet

- ART & CULTURAL AFTERLIFE: Opera, theatre, poetry, novels, films — how this event lives in culture

Compare the learner's recall against the topic definition and book sources. Identify:

1. CAPTURED: Specific facts or concepts from the definition/sources that the learner mentioned (even if imprecisely). Be generous — paraphrases count.
2. MISSED: The 2-3 most structurally important omissions — facts that serve as scaffolding for understanding the broader topic (key dates, actors, causal relationships). Prefer load-bearing facts over colorful details.
3. INTERESTING: Things the learner said that go BEYOND the sources — personal connections, questions, hypotheses, links to other topics. These are valuable signals.
4. WONDERINGS: Extract ALL questioning or curious statements — "I wonder...", "I'm not sure if...", "was it...?", "I'd like to know...", hedged questions, speculative connections, anything where the learner is reaching beyond what they know. These are the most valuable signals — err on the side of including too many. Rephrase as clear research questions.
5. RESEARCH_QUESTIONS: Specific questions that could be researched to deepen the learner's understanding. Derive from wonderings, gaps in knowledge, and interesting but uncertain claims. Frame as searchable questions.
6. ENTITIES_MENTIONED: List ALL people, places, events, and concepts the learner mentions by name. Use canonical forms (e.g., "Alexander the Great" not "Alexander").
7. CONFIDENCE_TAGGED: For each key claim the learner makes, tag their apparent confidence: "certain" (stated as fact), "uncertain" (hedged, "I think...", "maybe..."), or "wrong" (stated confidently but incorrect).
8. ORGANIZING_FRAMEWORK: How does the learner organize this knowledge? Options: "biographical_arc" (follows a person's life), "chronological" (events in order), "geographic" (places and regions), "thematic" (ideas and concepts), "causal" (cause and effect chains).
9. ADJACENT_NODES_COVERED: If the learner discusses topics that clearly overlap with OTHER curriculum nodes (not this one), list the likely node_ids from the available nodes above.

CURRICULUM NODES (candidate matches — the learner's knowledge may touch any of these):
{nodes_list}

LEARNER'S VOICE CAPTURE (transcribed speech):
{transcript}

Instructions:
1. ALWAYS extract every concrete FACT the learner states or implies, even if no curriculum nodes match. Be thorough — include dates, names, events, causal claims, and connections. Each fact should be a standalone statement. Facts with no matching node should have an empty node_ids array.
2. Map each fact to the most relevant curriculum node from the list above. Use the exact node_id. A fact can map to multiple nodes if relevant. CRITICAL MAPPING RULE: Only map a fact to a node if the fact is GENUINELY ABOUT that node's subject matter. The fact must belong to the same historical period and topic as the node. Do NOT map medieval facts to ancient nodes or vice versa. Do NOT map facts to nodes just because they share a word (e.g., a medieval monk writing is NOT about the Roman historian Tacitus; Arab prisoners are NOT about Roman slavery; medieval church politics is NOT about Roman religion). When in doubt, leave the fact unmapped (empty node_ids) rather than force a bad match.
3. For each node that has at least one mapped fact, assess the knowledge demonstrated:
   - "anchored": learner shows confident, detailed knowledge (multiple facts, connections, temporal placement)
   - "engaged": learner demonstrates real knowledge but with gaps or uncertainty
   - "mentioned": learner references the topic but with little substance
4. ALWAYS extract wonderings, questions, uncertainties, "I think...", "I'm not sure if...", speculative statements — even if no nodes match. These are the most valuable signals. Rephrase as clear research questions.
5. CONFIDENCE_TAGGED: For each key factual claim, tag the learner's apparent confidence: "certain" (stated as fact), "uncertain" (hedged, "I think...", "maybe..."), or "wrong" (stated confidently but incorrect).
6. ALWAYS provide overall_summary and entities_mentioned, regardless of node matching.

VOICE_CAPTURE_ENTITY_PROMPT = """Analyze a voice capture where a learner describes what they know about a topic.
This is NOT a recall test — the learner is freely sharing knowledge from a podcast, book, conversation, or their own thinking.
No curriculum structure exists for this topic. Your job is to extract concrete, testable facts organized by the main entities (people, places, events) being discussed.

{context_section}

{entity_info}

LEARNER'S VOICE CAPTURE (transcribed speech):
{transcript}

Instructions:
1. Identify the primary ENTITIES discussed: people, places, events, or specific concepts.
2. Group facts by entity. For each entity, extract every concrete, testable FACT into a question-answer pair suitable for spaced repetition review:
   - Each fact MUST have a specific question with a definite answer. BAD: "What happened?" GOOD: "In what year did Rollo's Vikings besiege Paris?"
   - "type" classifies the fact: "date" (when), "event" (what happened), "person" (who), "place" (where), "concept" (what/how), "cause" (why), "significance" (why it matters)
   - "source_excerpt" is 1-2 sentences quoted from the transcript that support this fact
3. Be thorough — include dates, names, causal claims, and connections. Aim for 3-8 facts per main entity.
4. Extract ALL wonderings, speculative statements, "I think...", "I'm not sure if..." — rephrase as clear research questions.
5. Tag each factual claim with confidence: "certain" (stated as fact), "uncertain" (hedged), "wrong" (stated confidently but incorrect).
6. List all entities mentioned (even if they don't have associated facts).
7. For each entity discussed OR mentioned, classify its type as one of: "person", "place", "event", "battle", "dynasty", "work", "organization", "concept". Include this in "entity_types".
8. Provide an overall_summary (2-3 sentences).

CANONICAL NAMING — critical for downstream Wikidata resolution:
- Use canonical Wikidata-style names. Prefer the form most likely to match a Wikidata label.
- STRIP parenthetical qualifiers. BAD: "Siege of Paris (885-886)"; GOOD: "Siege of Paris". BAD: "Russian Campaign (1708-1709)"; GOOD: "Russian campaign of Charles XII".
- STRIP honorifics and titles unless they are part of the canonical name. BAD: "Emperor Charles the Fat"; GOOD: "Charles the Fat". BAD: "King Karl XII of Sweden"; GOOD: "Karl XII of Sweden". But KEEP: "Pope Gregory VII" (title is canonical), "Count Odo of Paris" (disambiguation).
- For rulers with common English variants, prefer the most common English form. BAD: "Carl XII"; GOOD: "Karl XII of Sweden".
- This naming rule applies to BOTH the keys of entity_facts AND the entries in entities_mentioned AND the keys of entity_types.

Source text from book: {source_text}
Reader's current knowledge: {knowledge_level} (confidence: {confidence})

Create a PRIME→READ→TEST sequence:

1. PRIME: A casual question to activate memory (8-15 words). Start with "What do you remember about..." or "Do you recall why..." or "Can you picture..."

2. READ: 2-3 vivid, specific sentences that bring the topic alive. Include:
   - Concrete names, dates, places (not abstractions)
   - One sensory or dramatic detail ("the walls were 5km long", "he was 75 when he died in the siege")
   - One surprising connection or temporal anchor to another known event
   Keep it tight — this is a micro-narrative, not a textbook paragraph.

3. TEST: A focused question (6-12 words) whose answer is directly in the READ section. Tests understanding, not trivia. Start with What/Why/How.

4. ANSWER: 1-2 sentence answer guidance drawn from the READ section.

5. TEMPORAL_HOOK: One cross-period anchor connecting this to another era the reader might know.

Topics: {book_topics}

Curriculum nodes ({curriculum_title}) — level 2+ only:
{nodes_list}

Which nodes does this book substantially cover? For historical fiction, include nodes whose events, figures, or settings form part of the narrative. For nonfiction, include nodes whose subject matter is discussed in depth.

For each matched node:
- "node_id": exact ID from the list
- "node_title": node title
- "source_text": 1-2 sentences of SPECIFIC content from this book relevant to the node — name concrete characters, events, settings, arguments. For fiction: "Cicero's prosecution of Verres is a central plot arc in the novel, depicting the corruption of Roman provincial governance in Sicily." For nonfiction: "Chapter on the Arab conquest covers the fall of Syracuse in 878 and the shift to Palermo as capital."
- "lens": best retrieval lens — CAUSAL | COMPARATIVE | SIGNIFICANCE | TEMPORAL | PATTERN | CONSEQUENCE
- "confidence": how central this node is to the book — "high" (major theme/arc), "medium" (significant coverage), "low" (meaningful but secondary)

Be thorough — a 300-page book about Sicilian history might cover 20+ nodes. Don't under-count.

# ── Microlearning research ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MICROLEARNING_PROMPT = """You are a knowledgeable historian and educator. Write a microlearning card for
a reader studying history and culture. This reader is especially interested in primary sources,
cultural artifacts, and material evidence — not just "what happened" but "what survives and
what was created."

Research question: {query}

Context — the learner was reviewing this curriculum concept:
{node_title}: {node_description}

{learner_context}

If learner context is provided, tailor the card's depth to what the learner already knows.
Don't explain what they've already demonstrated understanding of. Build on their
existing connections and address their expressed curiosities.

Write:
1. A SHORT TITLE (under 60 chars) that names the specific subject with dates/years when relevant.
   Good: "The Catiline Conspiracy (63 BC)" or "Al-Idrisi's World Map for Roger II (1154)"
   Bad: "Cultural Blending in Medieval Sicily" or "An Ancient Conspiracy"

2. A vivid, specific answer as an array of labeled SECTIONS (total 200-350 words). Each section
   has a "heading" (short label, null for the opening narrative) and "text" (the paragraph).
   REQUIRED sections:
   - Opening narrative (heading: null): who, what, when, why it matters. 2-3 sentences.
     Write like a storyteller, not an encyclopedia. Name people with ages or epithets, give
     one concrete physical detail, make the reader feel the moment.
   - "Sources": Name specific authors and works. If the person wrote anything, mention it.
     If no sources survive, say so — absence is historically significant. Use proper titles
     without markdown formatting.
   - "Still Visible": What can you visit or see today? Buildings, inscriptions, coins,
     manuscripts in specific museums. Be concrete about locations.
   - Optionally one more: "Surprising Detail" or "Cultural Legacy" (art, opera, literature).
     The surprising detail should be genuinely unexpected — an ironic reversal, a personal
     quirk, a telling anecdote. Not just "this was influential."

3. 3-5 quiz questions testing SPECIFIC facts from the content. Short questions (6-15 words)
   with short specific answers (1-2 sentences). Each targets a different detail.

4. 6 follow-up queries that go SIDEWAYS — exploring angles the card DIDN'T cover. Don't repeat
   what's already in the content. Think: geography as explanation, counter-narratives, structural
   causes, transmission history, modern echoes, connected figures. Each should open a new rabbit hole.

5. Entities mentioned — people, places, events, concepts with canonical IDs.

Output JSON only:
{{"title":"short title with dates","sections":[{{"heading":null,"text":"opening narrative"}},{{"heading":"Sources","text":"primary source info"}},{{"heading":"Still Visible","text":"material evidence"}}],"quizzes":[{{"question":"...","answer":"..."}}],"follow_up_queries":["q1","q2","q3","q4","q5","q6"],"entities":[{{"name":"Archimedes","canonical":"archimedes_of_syracuse","type":"person"}}]}}"""


ENTITY_RESEARCH_PROMPT = """You are a knowledgeable historian. Write a rich microlearning card about this entity,
making connections to the learner's known context. Include primary sources and material evidence.

Entity: {entity_name} ({entity_type})
{entity_description}

Related entities from the same period or region that the learner has encountered:
{related_entities}

{learner_context}

If learner context is provided, weave in what the learner already knows about this
entity. Acknowledge their existing connections and build on them rather than repeating
basics they've already demonstrated.

Write:
1. A SHORT TITLE (under 60 chars) with dates when relevant.
   Good: "George of Antioch, Roger II's Admiral (d. 1151)" or "The Motya Charioteer (5th c. BC)"
   Bad: "An Important Historical Figure"

2. A vivid profile (3-5 SHORT paragraphs, 200-350 words) that:
   - Covers who/what this is and why it matters
   - Makes SPECIFIC connections to the related entities listed above
   - Names PRIMARY SOURCES: who wrote about this entity? What survives?
   - Names MATERIAL EVIDENCE: buildings, artifacts, inscriptions, museum objects
   - Includes one surprising or lesser-known detail

3. 3-5 quiz questions testing SPECIFIC facts. Short questions (6-15 words), short answers.

4. 6 follow-up queries latching onto specific details from the card content

5. Entities mentioned in the text

Output JSON only:
{{"title":"short title with dates","content":"the profile text","quizzes":[{{"question":"...","answer":"..."}}],"follow_up_queries":["q1","q2","q3","q4","q5","q6"],"entities":[{{"name":"Name","canonical":"canonical_id","type":"person|place|event|concept|period"}}]}}"""

genuinely curious — the kind that make you go "wait, really?" or "I never thought about it that way."

Entity: {entity_name} ({entity_type})
{entity_description}

{related_entities}

Requirements:
- Be SPECIFIC — name real people, places, events, dates
- At least one question should connect this entity to a related entity listed above
- Vary the angle: one factual/what-happened, one comparative/connection, one surprising/counter-intuitive
- NO generic templates like "How does X connect to Y?"

Entities they've mentioned: {entities}

Write a 300-500 word knowledge portrait covering:
1. KNOWLEDGE FRAMEWORK: How does the learner organize this domain? What's their mental model?
   (chronological? biographical? geographic? thematic?)
2. STRONG AREAS: What do they know well? Cite specific facts and connections they made.
3. GAPS AND MISCONCEPTIONS: What's missing or wrong? Be specific about what they got wrong
   and what critical facts they're missing.
4. INTERESTS AND CURIOSITIES: What topics excite them? What wonderings did they express?
5. CONNECTIONS: What cross-domain or unexpected links have they made?
6. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS: Based on this profile, what should they read or review next?

Write in second person ("You know...", "Your strongest area..."). Be specific — cite
their actual words and facts, don't generalize. This portrait will be injected into
every LLM prompt in this domain to personalize the learner's experience.

Create a PRIME->READ->TEST sequence that COMPARES the two perspectives:

1. PRIME: "What do you remember about [topic] from your reading?" (8-15 words)

2. READ: 3-4 sentences that juxtapose the two books' treatments. What does Book A emphasize that Book B doesn't? What's the same event seen from two angles? Include specific names, dates, details from both. Make the comparison vivid — this is not a summary, it's a dialogue between two authors.

3. TEST: A question (6-12 words) that requires understanding BOTH perspectives. "Why might [Author A] and [Author B] emphasize different aspects of [event]?" or "What does the contrast between [X] and [Y] reveal about [topic]?"

4. ANSWER: 2 sentences explaining the comparative insight.

# ── Knowledge Sweeps ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SWEEP_SCORING_PROMPT = """Score a knowledge sweep — a learner's free recall across an entire curriculum domain.

DOMAIN: {domain_title}

The learner was asked to recall what they know about each era/topic in this domain.
Below is their transcript (may cover multiple eras recorded sequentially).

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

CURRICULUM NODES (Level 1 and 2 — the expected coverage for a sweep):
{nodes_with_facts}

For EACH Level 1/2 node in the curriculum:
1. Was it mentioned at all? (yes/no)
2. What specific facts were stated about it? For each fact:
   - The claim (brief)
   - Correct or incorrect?
   - Match to a key_fact ID if possible
   - Excerpt from transcript
3. What depth was demonstrated?
   - "surface": just named or referenced in passing
   - "textbase": recalled specific facts (dates, names, events)
   - "situation_model": showed causal reasoning, connections to other nodes, perspective-taking

For CONNECTIONS between nodes:
- List every pair of nodes the learner explicitly connected
- Type: causal ("X led to Y"), temporal ("at the same time as"), comparative ("unlike X, Y..."), cross_domain

For ORGANIZATION:
- Did the learner proceed chronologically? Thematically? Randomly?
- Count causal language ("because", "led to", "as a result", "which caused")
- Count perspective-taking and counterfactual statements

IMPORTANT scoring rules:
- Be generous with matching: paraphrases count, approximate dates count (±20 years for ancient, ±5 for modern)
- A vague reference ("the Greeks colonized Sicily") counts as surface mention of the relevant node
- Only mark "incorrect" for clear factual errors (wrong century, wrong attribution, events that didn't happen)
- If the learner conflates two nodes, credit both as mentioned
